# Recommendation_System

Introduction:- The absence of a recommendation system poses a significant challenge for startups in their quest for growth and success. In today's highly competitive business environment, where customers are overwhelmed with choices and information, startups must provide personalized and relevant recommendations to stand out. However, due to financial constraints, many startups cannot invest in developing a robust recommendation system or hire a team of machine learning engineers to tackle this crucial aspect of their business. One of the primary reasons why startups struggle to grow without a recommendation system is the inability to understand their target market effectively. Furthermore, startups often face resource limitations, especially regarding financial capital. Building a recommendation system from scratch requires a substantial investment in time and money. Hiring a team of machine learning engineers and data scientists to develop and maintain such a system can be prohibitively expensive for startups operating on tight budgets. As a result, they find themselves at a significant disadvantage compared to their larger, more established competitors who can afford to invest in advanced recommendation technologies.
